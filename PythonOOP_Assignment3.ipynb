        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects**, which represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). It promotes concepts like **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**. OOP makes programs more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming, a **class** is a **blueprint or template** for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have. In simple terms, a class represents the structure and behavior of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming, an **object** is an **instance of a class**. It represents a real-world entity and contains both **data (attributes)** and **functions (methods)** defined by its class. Objects allow us to use and interact with the features described in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Here’s the difference between **abstraction** and **encapsulation** in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** is about **hiding implementation details** and showing only the essential features to the user. (Focus: *What a system does*).\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** is about **bundling data and methods together** and restricting direct access to some components using access modifiers. (Focus: *How data is protected*).\n",
        "\n",
        " In short: *Abstraction = hiding implementation*, *Encapsulation = hiding data*.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - **Dunder methods** (short for *double underscore methods*) in Python are **special built-in methods** that start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`). They let you define how objects of a class should behave with Python’s built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__init__` → initializes an object.\n",
        "* `__str__` → defines string representation.\n",
        "* `__add__` → allows use of `+` with objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are also called **magic methods**.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - **Inheritance** in OOP is a concept where a class (called the **child class** or **subclass**) can **reuse the properties and methods** of another class (called the **parent class** or **superclass**).\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy.\n",
        "For example, if `Car` is a parent class, then `ElectricCar` can inherit its attributes (like wheels, engine) and methods, while also adding its own unique features.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, inheritance models an **“is-a” relationship**.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - **Polymorphism** in OOP means **one name, many forms** — the same method or operator can behave differently based on the object or data type it is used with.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: The `+` operator adds numbers (`2 + 3 = 5`) but also\n",
        "\n",
        "concatenates strings (`\"Hi\" + \"!\" = \"Hi!\"`).\n",
        "* In classes, different objects can have the same method name but implement it differently (method overriding).\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism increases flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, **encapsulation** is achieved by **restricting direct access to variables and methods** and controlling them through getters and setters. This is done using **access modifiers**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Public members**: Accessible everywhere (`name`).\n",
        "* **Protected members**: Indicated with a single underscore (`_name`) → should not be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "* **Private members**: Indicated with double underscores (`__name`) → name mangling makes them harder to access directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.__name = name     # private variable\n",
        "        self.__age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_name(self):       # getter\n",
        "        return self.__name\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def set_age(self, age):   # setter\n",
        "        if age > 0:\n",
        "            self.__age = age\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `__name` and `__age` are encapsulated, and can only be accessed or modified via methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. In Python, a **constructor** is a special method named **`__init__`** that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. It is used to **initialize the object’s attributes**.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # constructor\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object\n",
        "s1 = Student(\"Alice\", 20)\n",
        "print(s1.name, s1.age)   # Output: Alice 20\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `__init__` sets the initial values of `name` and `age` for each `Student` object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, **class methods** and **static methods** are special kinds of methods defined inside a class:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Class Method (`@classmethod`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Takes **`cls`** as the first parameter (represents the class, not the object).\n",
        "   * Can access or modify **class-level attributes**, but not instance attributes.\n",
        "   * Declared using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Student:\n",
        "       count = 0  # class variable\n",
        "       \n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",
        "           Student.count += 1\n",
        "       \n",
        "       @classmethod\n",
        "       def get_count(cls):\n",
        "           return cls.count\n",
        "       \n",
        "   print(Student.get_count())  # Access without object\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        " **Static Method (`@staticmethod`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Does **not take `self` or `cls`** as the first parameter.\n",
        "   * Cannot access class or instance attributes directly.\n",
        "   * Works like a normal function but belongs to the class for better organization.\n",
        "   * Declared using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Math:\n",
        "       @staticmethod\n",
        "       def add(x, y):\n",
        "           return x + y\n",
        "       \n",
        "   print(Math.add(5, 7))  # Call without creating object\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In short:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Instance Method** → works with object (`self`).\n",
        "* **Class Method** → works with class (`cls`).\n",
        "* **Static Method** → works independently, just grouped inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, **method overloading** means defining multiple methods with the **same name but different parameters**.\n",
        "However, unlike Java or C++, Python does **not support true method overloading**. If you define multiple methods with the same name, the **last one overrides the previous ones**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, Python achieves overloading using **default arguments** or **`*args` and `**kwargs`**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with default arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Math:\n",
        "    def add(self, x=0, y=0, z=0):\n",
        "        return x + y + z\n",
        "\n",
        "m = Math()\n",
        "print(m.add(5, 10))      # 15\n",
        "print(m.add(5, 10, 20))  # 35\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with `*args`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Math:\n",
        "    def add(self, *args):\n",
        "        return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "m = Math()\n",
        "print(m.add(2, 3))        # 5\n",
        "print(m.add(2, 3, 4, 5))  # 14\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "So, Python **simulates method overloading** using flexible arguments, not by multiple method definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - **Method overriding** in OOP happens when a **child class provides its own implementation** of a method that is already defined in the **parent class**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The method in the child class must have the **same name, parameters, and return type** as in the parent class.\n",
        "* It allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of the parent’s method.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        return \"Some generic sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):   # overriding parent method\n",
        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "a = Animal()\n",
        "d = Dog()\n",
        "print(a.sound())  # Output: Some generic sound\n",
        "print(d.sound())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " This is **runtime polymorphism**, since the method to be executed is decided at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the **`@property` decorator** is used to define a method that can be accessed like an **attribute**, without explicitly calling it. It is commonly used to **implement getters, setters, and deleters** in a clean and Pythonic way.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self._radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def radius(self):        # getter\n",
        "        return self._radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    @radius.setter\n",
        "    def radius(self, value): # setter\n",
        "        if value <= 0:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Radius must be positive\")\n",
        "        self._radius = value\n",
        "\n",
        "    @radius.deleter\n",
        "    def radius(self):        # deleter\n",
        "        del self._radius\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(c.radius)    # Access like attribute → 5\n",
        "c.radius = 10      # Calls setter\n",
        "print(c.radius)    # 10\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " In short: `@property` lets you manage attribute access **with methods, but used like variables**.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - **Polymorphism** is important in OOP because it makes code more **flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It allows the **same interface** (like a method name) to work with **different types of objects**.\n",
        "* It supports **extensibility**, since new classes can define their own behavior without changing existing code.\n",
        "* It helps in achieving **runtime flexibility** (method overriding) and **code readability**.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: A function `make_sound(animal)` can call `animal.sound()`, and whether the object is a `Dog`, `Cat`, or `Bird`, the correct method is executed — without modifying the function.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An **abstract class** in Python is a class that **cannot be instantiated** directly and is meant to serve as a **blueprint for other classes**. It can have **abstract methods** (methods declared but not implemented) that must be implemented in the child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, abstract classes are defined using the **`abc` (Abstract Base Class) module**.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):             # Abstract class\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def area(self):           # Abstract method\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Circle(Shape):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self.radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    def area(self):           # Must implement abstract method\n",
        "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(c.area())  # 78.5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " Key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstract classes ensure **common structure** across subclasses.\n",
        "* They help achieve **abstraction** by forcing subclasses to implement certain methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - The main **advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** are:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Modularity** – Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to understand and manage.\n",
        " **Reusability** – Inheritance allows reusing existing code without rewriting it.\n",
        " **Flexibility & Extensibility** – Polymorphism and abstraction make it easy to extend or modify functionality.\n",
        " **Data Security** – Encapsulation protects data by controlling access through getters and setters.\n",
        " **Maintainability** – Easier to debug, update, and maintain large projects.\n",
        "\n",
        " In short: OOP makes software **organized, reusable, secure, and maintainable**.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Here’s the difference between a **class variable** and an **instance variable** in Python (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class Variable**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Shared by **all objects** of the class.\n",
        "  * Defined **inside the class but outside methods**.\n",
        "  * Changing it affects all instances (unless overridden in an object).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Instance Variable**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Unique to **each object**.\n",
        "  * Defined **inside methods (usually `__init__`) using `self`**.\n",
        "  * Changing it affects only that particular object.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
